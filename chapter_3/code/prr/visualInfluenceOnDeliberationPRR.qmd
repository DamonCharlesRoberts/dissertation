  Though political deliberation benefits those often excluded from politics, many individuals avoid such situations in an age of hyper-partisanship and affective polarization. Existing literature on this topic argue that individuals often seek to avoid uncomfortable situations that are caused by disagreement about politics. The outcomes of such motivations are often thought to increase affective polarization and to have negative participatory impacts for those who are often excluded or feel unwelcome in politics. Much of this work assumes that people know the partisanship of potential discussion partners and avoid those who are known to be out-partisans. For those that are strangers, we often can rely on cultural stereotypes of the other party to help us assume the partisanship of this potential discussion partner. This project argues that even more simple visual information can and is used by individuals to decide whether or not to engage in a discussion with another and can shape the outcomes of a conversation. It lays out a cognitive mechanism explaining how individuals make decisions to engage in a conversation and the limits by which deliberation may buffer political polarization.

# Introduction

While colors may have increasingly strong associations between partisanship, it is unclear the extent to which they influence political behavior. The existing literature in political science demonstrates that social groups, and particularly partisanship, motivate vast amounts of political behavior. One primary way that this manifests is the degree to which we interact with those in our group versus outside of our group. Rooted in classic social identity theory, the argument is that we have these tendencies out of a motivation to defend our pre-existing beliefs [@kunda_1990_pb;@jost_et-al_2022_n]. Evidence of this occurring manifests in a number of political [see @iyengar_westwood_2015_ajps] and even non-political contexts [@nicholson_et-al_2016_pb].

One critical way that this tendency to avoid views we disagree with manifests is through whom we choose to have conversations with. Political deliberation is often considered to be a central component of political behavior in American democracy [@huckfeldt_2007_ohpb] and does not skew as heavily on socio-demographic and socio-economic factors as other forms of engagement such as protest or contacting one's representatives [@schlozman_et-al_2013_pup]. Deliberation is often thought to encourage many different forms of participation in politics [@verba_et-al_1995_hup;@klofstad_2007_prq], increase one's levels of political knowledge [@mcclurg_2003_prq] and to buffer the animosity toward out-partisans [@levendusky_stecula_2021_cup]. Despite its benefits, there are a number of limitations. First, many of our networks for whom we talk to regularly are constructed of close friends and family and we are often reluctant to harm those relationships through disagreement [@mutz_2002_apsr;@mutz_2006_cup]. Second, even outside of our family and close friends, our networks are quite politically homogenous [@huckfeldt_sprague_1987;@butters_hare_2022_pb]. Third, evidence suggests that even if are offered information from other political perspectives, we either do not try to integrate it with our prior beliefs [@kunda_1990_pb;@lodge_taber_2013_cup] or the benefits of such information do not last very long [@levendusky_stecula_2021_cup].

We do not always enter a political conversation having complete information, however. If we have conversations, that may start out about politics or evolve into it, with those that we have limited information on about their political views, we do not know whether to avoid having a political conversation. At least that is a common assumption underlying the more optimistic perspectives on our capacity to buffer polarization. There are some that have begun to suggest that we can rely on visual information about others to guess what their political beliefs are before we initiate a conversation. For example, @carlson_settle_2022_cup argue that we can use the clothing of others to make an informed guess about the partisanship of a potential discussion partner. For example, it would probably be reasonable to assume that someone wearing a Patagonia jacket would be a Democrat and someone wearing a Carhart jacket would be Republican. Just these assumptions based on the appearance of another person can lead someone to avoid a potential political conversation with others [@carlson_settle_2022_cup].

I argue that the visual information required to encourage such behavior need not necessarily be that complex. Colors convey significant amounts of information. Visual information such as color is among the fastest types of information that humans process [see @ames_et-al_2012_ohsn]. Colors in particular are deeply embedded into a number of schemas that organize our previous experiences which enable the processing and reacting to new information [see @cimbalo_et-al_1978_jgp]. Colors not only have strong associations with our affective state [see @mehta_zhu_2009_s;@elliot_maier_2012_aesp], but they also convey significant amounts of information about social groups [@pietraszewski_et-al_2015_c].

I argue that politically-relevant colors, red and blue, are important informational cues that individuals can rely upon to evaluate others and their ideological positions when politics is salient to them. The implication of this argument is that when individuals make such connections, we can predict behavioral motivations and outcomes depending on one's valanced associations with those colors in a political context. This project elaborates on how this occurs and then uses experimental data to test my argument.

Colors and visual information are among the first pieces of information that we detect, process, organize, and store when interacting with an external object [see @ames_et-al_2013_ohsn]. From an evolutionary biologist's perspective, efficient visual information processing and its centrality for our cognitive schemas is a massive advantage for survival [see @norman_et-al_2012_ohsn]. Due to its value, visual information has strong associations that appear throughout our cognitive structures. On a fundamental level, the connection between emotion and even simple information like color is well established [see @cimbalo_et-al_1978_jgp;@mehta_zhu_2009_s;@dandrade_egan_1974_ae;@valdez_mehrabian_1994 for a number of examples].

Emotion is also a central neurological process, though it remains quite an elusive process. To memory and information processing, emotion plays a central role. Affect-laden information is processed at dizzily fast rates and help form stronger associations between new information and previously encoded memories [@kensinger_fields_2022_ohhum]. The formation of memories are quite complex processes and many factors predict the degree to which one memory becomes central versus an ancillary memory that is eventually forgotten [@kahana_et-al_2022_ohhum]. One powerful predictor of this, however, is the emotional salience associated with an object [@kahana_et-al_2022_ohhum].

Emotions are central components to predicting behavioral outcomes, though the means by which they do this are complex [@winkielman_et-al_2011_ohsn; @sander_2013_chhan;@ralph_anderson_2018_pup;@dror_2017_er]. Simple emotions like anxiety and fear are associated with either "approach" or "avoid" behaviors [@marcus_et-al_2000_ucp]. One way in which these affective responses emerge is through their strong connection with social groupings [@albertson_et-al_2020_ohep]. That is, in-group and out-group behaviors documented by social psychologists are detectable in cognitive processes -- even unconscious ones [@zahn_et-al_2011_ohsn;@zink_barter_2012_ohsn].
