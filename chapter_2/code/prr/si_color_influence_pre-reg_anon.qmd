abstract: |
  Are colors important to politics as a form of political information? In this project I argue that they are. Building upon existing theories of political information processing and common theories of information processing, attitude formation, and affect in neuroscience, I present a snap-judgement model of political information processing. In this model, colors provide automatic information about a politically-relevant object that may shape subsequent processing of more complex information that the political science literature is more familiar with. The model has important implications for how we consider the role that visual information has on political information processing and attitude formation. The model additionally provides clarity on motivations behind party branding and the ways in which information may activate partisan biases pre-consciously.
